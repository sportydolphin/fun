// The site changelog, newest first. Split out of ./version.ts so it stays out of the entry
// chunk. See the note there. Loaded on demand when the "What's New" dialog opens.
// Only the newest releases live here; older ones are archived under ./changelog/ by minor-version
// range and appended below, so a new entry is a small edit at the top of a small file. When this
// list passes 1.249.x, move 1.200 to 1.249 into its own archive file the same way.
//
// ONLY THE NEWEST ARCHIVE COMES WITH THE DIALOG. The dialog opens on five days, and this file
// alone cannot fill them, so 1.150 to 1.199 rides along; the older archives (about 230 KB and up
// of prose, most of the dialog's chunk) load when a reader asks for earlier updates. Until
// Oct 15, 2026 every archive was a static import here, and the dialog's chunk was 80 KB gzipped.
